xockets.io (pronounced zockets.io, for XPages websockets) plugin adds support for browser based websockets in the XPages runtime.  
It leverages Netty.io websocket libraries to easily scale to a large number of users.  This plugin replaces the websocket implementation 
found in the webshell-xpages-ext-lib hence the 2.0.0 release.  Below is a list of the latest features available in xockets.io:


xockets.io as of 2.0.6
-Fix applied for multiple targets in a message targeting URIs


xockets.io as of 2.0.5
-Updated the underlying Netty server to 4.1.1 due to security vulnerability in 4.1.0


xockets.io as of 2.0.4
-Fixed issue with IE11 disconnecting after 30 seconds of inactivity
-Updated underlying Netty server to the final release of 4.1.0
-Fixed issue with remove-script command not working from console


xockets.io as of 2.0.3
-Fixed embedded client's max message size.  It now uses the WEBSOCKET_MAX_MSG_SIZE value from the server
-Fixed reload-scripts and show-scripts command line call from the console (last release I had disabled / removed accidentally)
-Added enhancement to allow multiple targets in a SocketMessage.  New attribute introduced "targets".  Use instead of "to" field when sending to multiple
-Added enhancement to allow multiple websocket connections per user based on URI.


xockets.io as of 2.0.2
-Enhanced to accomodate a simple proxy to allow the websocket server and Domino http server to run off of one port
-Setup xockets.io to use Netty's tc-native SSL feature.  It uses OpenSSL to handle network encryption.  
I had to back-port the java code to 1.6 since and create a custom build.  
Currently the OpenSSL feature is windows only, Linux is supported, I just haven't had time to create the build.
-Code cleanup / refactoring

xockets.io as of 2.0.1
-Fixed a problem with the plugin importing to the designer client (indirect reference to unneeded plugin removed)
-Updated the logic for message durability to save an inbound message during the onMessage method instead of during the send.
-(NOT TESTED YET) Added native transport settings WEBSOCKET_NATIVE_TRANSPORT for Linux based systems only (reduces memory consumption and GC overhead)
-Refactored NettyTestClient to use main method invocation so the loaded websocket clients stay loaded throughout the entire test.
-Refactored some of the notes api java operations for performance (e.g. use unid instead of view lookup where possible)
-Updated Config object to be based off an interface for easier substitutions during testing.
-Updated some netty calls to reduce memory overhead and GC
-(NOT TESTED) Removed the XPage 9.0.1 plugin references.  This might allow the websocket plugin to function in 8.5.3



xockets.io as of 2.0.0
-Use of Netty as the websocket/networking engine
-Increased scale (tested locally with 15k websocket connections / users)
-Granular control of threading, send / receive buffers to tweak performance of the server
-Configuration can be stored in a profile document, or notes.ini (both use name/value pairs)
-You will no longer be restricted to using the server's Id.  Any Id can be configured to integrate with the Domino server
-Server.id password no longer has to be empty (websocket server initializes with trusted session, then reverts to configured userId)
-Rhino embedded JavaScript clients can be registered and run under their own Ids as well (e.g. chatapp user)
-Added Origin based security patch to prohibit Cross-Site Websocket Hijacking (CSWSH) (you must configure allowed Origins e.g. mysite.com, yoursite.com, oursite.com)
-Added security patch to make sure the logged in user has at least reader access to the nsf if the websocket url contains the nsf as part of its path. 
-Added LRU SystemCache reference available to your Rhino JavaScript libraries to share and persist data between SSJS library invocations (scoped to class, so be careful with your keys).
