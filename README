xockets.io (pronounced zockets.io, for XPages websockets) plugin adds support for browser based websockets in the XPages runtime.  
It leverages Netty.io websocket libraries to easily scale to a large number of users.  This plugin replaces the websocket implementation 
found in the webshell-xpages-ext-lib hence the 2.0.0 release.  Below is a list of the latest features available in xockets.io:


xockets.io as of 2.0.1
Fixed a problem with the feature plugin referencing a plugin indirectly that may have caused problems during the installation on the client or server.  
Also, updated the logic for message durability to save an inbound message during the onMessage method instead of during the send.



xockets.io as of 2.0.0
-Use of Netty as the websocket/networking engine
-Increased scale (tested locally with 15k websocket connections / users)
-Granular control of threading, send / receive buffers to tweak performance of the server
-Configuration can be stored in a profile document, or notes.ini (both use name/value pairs)
-You will no longer be restricted to using the server's Id.  Any Id can be configured to integrate with the Domino server
-Server.id password no longer has to be empty (websocket server initializes with trusted session, then reverts to configured userId)
-Rhino embedded JavaScript clients can be registered and run under their own Ids as well (e.g. chatapp user)
-Added Origin based security patch to prohibit Cross-Site Websocket Hijacking (CSWSH) (you must configure allowed Origins e.g. mysite.com, yoursite.com, oursite.com)
-Added security patch to make sure the logged in user has at least reader access to the nsf if the websocket url contains the nsf as part of its path. 
-Added LRU SystemCache reference available to your Rhino JavaScript libraries to share and persist data between SSJS library invocations (scoped to class, so be careful with your keys).
